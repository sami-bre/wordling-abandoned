# wordling - abandoned

Wordling is essentially a dictionary app for android and linux. It utilizes the urbandictionary API.
In addition to looking up words, wordling also allows for saving definitions offline for studying.

The app is not complete yet.


Well, the above was true once upon a time. But then the design became too complicaated too quickly and I didn't know what I was doing :(. Nevertheless, these files (the once in the 'lib' directory) contain some pretty code with working animations and widgets appearing and disappearing. So I thought I'd better leave the abandoned code undeleted. Actually, the unfinished app can be run in debug mode.

The concept of wordling is now implemented in the 'Wordling' repository I created anew.
